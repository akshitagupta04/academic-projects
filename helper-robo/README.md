## Project Context 
This group project was designed during the 6th semester of the undergraduate program in the 2019–2020 academic year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, college laboratories were closed and access to certain hardware components was restricted. As a result, the project could not be fully assembled, and a single combined program for the complete system could not be implemented. 

However, 80% of the planned project components were interfaced with Arduino UNO R3, combined into a single program and tested. The final system integration described in the project documentation is based on the intended design and planned assembly of all components. 

### Project Declaration
I hereby declare that the work, which is being presented in the Project, entitled “Helper Robo” in partial fulfillment for the award of Degree of “Bachelor of Technology” with Specialization in Electronics and Communication Engineering and submitted to the Department of Electronics, Banasthali Vidyapith, Rajasthan is a record of my own investigations carried under the guidance of “Mr. Hemant Kumar”, Department of Electronics, Banasthali Vidyapith. 

I have not submitted the matter presented in this report anywhere for the award of any other Degree.

## Functional Description 

---

## Hardware and Software 
### Hardware 
Board: Arduino UNO R3

### Software 
Port: Com 3 Serial Port (USB)

---

## System Design and Testing
Documentation, including schematic captures, testing images and block diagram

## Future Enhancement: 
While the initial design utilised a Bluetooth module, which limits operational range. This project has inspired potential improvements, such as adapting it into a radar-based drone for broader applications. 

- Detection of chemicals and toxicants in rivers also for reduction of water pollution.
- Detection of chemicals in human body with Human Area Networking Technology.

---

## Key Contributions 
- Integrated the Arduino Uno R3 with L293D motor driver IC, DC gear motors, HC-05 Bluetooth module, MQ-7 & MQ-135 gas sensors and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor into a single, functional prototype.
- Programmed gas sensors and ultrasonic sensor with the Arduino Uno R3 to measure and output precise concentration (in ppm) and readings to the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor.
- Implemented wireless control for the DC gear motors via HC-05 Bluetooth module and smartphone app for controlling direction, movement and speed.
- Documented the project comprehensively in a final report for academic evaluation.
