## Project Context 
This group project was designed during the 6th semester of the undergraduate program in the 2019–2020 academic year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, college laboratories were closed and access to certain hardware components was restricted. As a result, the project could not be fully assembled, and a single combined program for the complete system could not be implemented. 

However, 80% of the planned project components were interfaced with Arduino UNO R3, combined into a single program and tested individually using separate programs. The final system integration described in the project documentation is based on the intended design and planned assembly of all components. 

### Project Declaration
I hereby declare that the work, which is being presented in the Project, entitled “Helper Robo” in partial fulfillment for the award of Degree of “Bachelor of Technology” with Specialization in Electronics and Communication Engineering and submitted to the Department of Electronics, Banasthali Vidyapith, Rajasthan is a record of my own investigations carried under the guidance of “Mr. Hemant Kumar”, Department of Electronics, Banasthali Vidyapith. 

I have not submitted the matter presented in this report anywhere for the award of any other Degree.
