## Overview 
Helper Robo is an Arduino-based robot designed to detect and measure harmful gases in hazardous environments like underground mines and landfills. It addresses critical safety needs. 

While the initial design utilised a Bluetooth module, which limits operational range. This project has inspired potential improvements, such as adapting it into a radar-based drone for broader applications.

## Project Context 
This project was designed during the 6th semester of the undergraduate program in the 2019–2020 academic year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, college laboratories were closed and access to certain hardware components was restricted. As a result, the project could not be fully assembled, and a single combined program for the complete system could not be implemented. 

However, most of the planned project components were interfaced with Arduino UNO R3, combined into a single program and tested individually using separate programs. The final system integration described in the project documentation is based on the intended design and planned assembly of all components.
