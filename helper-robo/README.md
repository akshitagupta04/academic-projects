## Overview 
Helper Robo is an Arduino-based robot designed to detect and measure harmful gases remotely in hazardous environments like underground mines and landfills. The aim of this project is to detect the percentage of toxic gases present in such environments. 

This project was designed during the 6th semester of the undergraduate program in the 2019–2020 academic year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, college laboratories were closed and access to certain hardware components was restricted. As a result, the project could not be fully assembled, and a single combined program for the complete system could not be implemented. 

However, most of the planned project components were interfaced with Arduino UNO R3 and tested individually using separate programs. The final system integration described in the project documentation is based on the intended design and planned assembly of all components.
