# Microcontroller Communication Protocols 
An AVR-based RFID security access control system in which only authorised personnel are allowed access to a secure area, developed during embedded system design training. Using this system, authorization of personnel is carried out with an RFID card and only those with access can enter a secured area.

## Project Context 
This project was completed via online training during Covid-19, with functionality verified through trainer-led Proteus and AVR co-simulation demonstrations. 

--- 

## Functional Description 

--- 

## Hardware and Software 

--- 

## System Design 
Documentation, including schematic capture and block diagram available in [System Design](System%20Design)

--- 

## Future Enhancement 

--- 

## Key Contributions 
- Designed the circuit schematic in Proteus design suite software. 
- Programmed the ATmega16 microcontroller in AVR programming, utilising the UART communication protocol for system operation under trainer guidance. 
- Simulated the full system by performing co-simulation between schematic and AVR programming, loading the generated hex file to validate functionality. 
- Documented the project comprehensively in a final report and created the presentation for academic evaluation.
